Fixed the case of certain sounds being reversed when toggling playback and adjusting effect params.
Added the fade_pool function into the program. When you press escape, instead of immediately exiting the app, it will now fade the pitch of the music before quitting the app. Think of it like a tape stop effect on the sound.
